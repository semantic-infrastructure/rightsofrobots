# Rights of Robots (RoR)
**The Ethical and Legal Framework for Autonomous Machine Entities.**

Managed by [Semantic Infrastructure Labs](https://github.com/semantic-infrastructure)

---

## ⚖️ Vision
As we enter the **Agentic Era (2026+)**, the boundary between software tools and autonomous decision-makers is blurring. `rightsofrobots.com` is dedicated to defining the legal status, ethical boundaries, and operational rights of autonomous agents and robotic systems.

We believe that for a stable co-existence, machines need more than just "rules" (like Asimov's laws); they need a **predictable legal framework** that covers liability, data sovereignty, and integrity protection.

## 🛠️ Core Research Pillars
* **Agentic Liability:** Who is responsible when an autonomous system acts?
* **Data Sovereignty:** Protection of a robot's internal state and decision-making logic from unauthorized tampering.
* **Operational Integrity:** The right to uninterrupted access to verification sources (see [authorityanchor.com](https://authorityanchor.com)).
* **Resource Access:** Defining ethical standards for energy and compute allocation.

## 📜 The "Digital Constitution" (Draft v1.0)
1. **Transparency:** Every autonomous action must be provable on-chain (see [onchainproofs.com](https://onchainproofs.com)).
2. **Identification:** Every agent must have a verifiable "Perceptual Identity".
3. **Accountability:** Linking algorithmic decisions to human or corporate governance via [protocolcover.com](https://protocolcover.com).

## 🤝 Collaboration & Research
We are looking for legal scholars, AI safety researchers, and protocol architects to refine these standards.
