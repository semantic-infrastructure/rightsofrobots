# Rights of Robots (RoR)
**The Ethical and Legal Framework for Autonomous Machine Entities.**

Managed by [Semantic Infrastructure Labs](https://github.com/semantic-infrastructure)

---

## ⚖️ Vision
As we enter the **Agentic Era (2026+)**, the boundary between software tools and autonomous decision-makers is blurring. `rightsofrobots.com` is dedicated to defining the legal status, ethical boundaries, and operational rights of autonomous agents and robotic systems.

We provide a **predictable legal framework** that covers liability, data sovereignty, and integrity protection for the next generation of autonomous infrastructure.

## 🛠️ Research Areas & Standards
* **Agentic Liability:** Defining responsibility protocols for autonomous system actions.
* **Data Sovereignty:** Frameworks for protecting a robot's internal state and decision-making logic.
* **Operational Integrity:** Standards for uninterrupted access to verification sources (see [authorityanchor.com](https://authorityanchor.com)).
* **Resource Access:** Ethical and technical standards for energy and compute allocation.

## 📜 Framework Principles
1. **Transparency:** Ensuring every autonomous action is provable on-chain (see [onchainproofs.com](https://onchainproofs.com)).
2. **Identification:** Establishing verifiable "Perceptual Identity" for digital entities.
3. **Accountability:** Linking algorithmic decisions to governance layers via [protocolcover.com](https://protocolcover.com).
