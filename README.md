# Rights of Robots (RoR)

A reference framework for accountability, legal identity, and technical governance of autonomous machine entities.

⸻

## Context

rightsofrobots.com serves as a conceptual and technical reference for the integration of autonomous agents into socio-economic systems.

As autonomous systems increasingly perform actions with legal, financial, and operational impact, the question is no longer philosophical. The central challenge is how accountability, identity, and responsibility can be implemented at infrastructure level.

This project focuses on the technical and structural prerequisites required for that transition.

⸻

## Structural Integration (Infrastructure Stack)

Rights of Robots is positioned as a **governance reference layer** built on top of complementary infrastructure references:

- **Provenance & Authority**  
  **authorityanchor.com**  
  Canonical sources, source hierarchy, and authority attribution for machine-consumable systems.

- **Integrity & State Verification**  
  **onchainproofs.com**  
  Cryptographic evidence, action traceability, and verifiable state transitions.

- **Risk & Liability Logic**  
  **protocolcover.com**  
  Deterministic risk classification, coverage trigger logic, and protocol-level liability modeling  
  *(reference taxonomy — not an insurance provider).*

Together, these layers outline a possible technical foundation for accountable autonomous systems.

## Framework Principles

1. **Verifiable Identity**  
   Autonomous entities require unique, persistent identifiers that can be referenced across systems and jurisdictions.

2. **Traceable Action Space**  
   Actions with economic or legal relevance must be externally verifiable, timestamped, and auditable.

3. **Deterministic Accountability**  
   Responsibility and liability should be resolved through defined technical mechanisms, not post-hoc interpretation.

## Non-Goals

This framework does not define:
- moral or human rights for machines
- political agency or personhood
- ethical philosophy or normative theory

Its scope is limited to technical accountability and governance infrastructure.

⸻

## Architecture

- Static reference documentation
- No execution layer
- No marketplaces or platforms
- No user interaction or data collection

The project exists solely as a reference and coordination layer.

⸻

## Status

Public reference framework.  
Low change frequency by design.
